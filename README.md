This GitHub repository contains a capstone-project that was written for the course 'Data-mining in R' at the University of Lucerne in spring 2023. The project aims to analyse a limited number of Swiss parliamentarian speeches from the 50th legislation (30.11.2015 - 01.12.2019) and visualize the results appealingly.

## Content

The core of the project is a sentiment analysis using ChatGPT from OpenAI. The main questions were:
- How positive / negative do politicians from certain parties speak about the motions of politicians from the own or other parties.
- How left or right and conservative or liberal are the speeches in the statements about the motions?

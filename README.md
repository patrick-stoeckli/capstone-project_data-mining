## University of Lucerne, Spring 2023

This GitHub repository contains a capstone-project that was written for the course 'Data Mining in R' at the University of Lucerne in spring 2023. The project aims to analyse a limited number of Swiss parliamentarian speeches from the 50th legislation (30.11.2015 - 01.12.2019) and to visualize the results appealingly.

## Content

The core of the project is a sentiment analysis using ChatGPT from OpenAI. The main questions are:
- How positive or negative do politicians speak about the motions of politicians from the own or other parties?
- How left or right and conservative or liberal are the statements about the motions and does it depend on the political party the politicians belong to?
- How complex and formal is the use of language of politicians in their statements about motions and does it depend on the political party the politicians belong to?
